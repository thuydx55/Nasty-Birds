Artemis-Cpp
===

A C++ port of [Artemis Entity System Framework](http://gamadu.com/artemis/tutorial.html).

The port was orignially written by [Sidar Talei](https://bitbucket.org/stalei/artemiscpp/src), in which he used several C++11 features such as deleted function, variadic templates, nullptr, etcâ€¦ We wanted the framework to be portable, so we removed all C++11 feature usages so that it compiles well on "older" compiler.	


### PORTED CLASSES

- Component
- ComponentMapper
- ComponentType
- ComponentTypeManager
- Entity
- EntityProcessingSystem
- EntitySystem
- SystemBitManager
- ImmutableBag
- EntityManager
- DelayedEntityProcessingSystem
- DelayedEntitySystem
- GroupManager
- IntervalEntityProcessingSystem
- IntervalEntitySystem
- Manager
- SystemManager
- TagManager
- utils
- World
- Bag

### EXAMPLE

`VelocityComponent` and `PositionComponent`.

``` cpp
class VelocityComponent : public artemis::Component {
public:
    float velocityX;
    float velocityY;

    MovementComponent(float velocityX, float velocityY)
    {
        this->velocityX = velocityX;
        this->velocityY = velocityY;
    };
};

class PositionComponent : public artemis::Component
{

public:
    float posX;
    float posY;
    PositionComponent(float posX, float posY)
    {
        this->posX = posX;
        this->posY = posY;
    };
};
```
	
MovementSystem updates positions base on velocities

``` cpp
class MovementSystem : public artemis::EntityProcessingSystem {
private:
    artemis::ComponentMapper<MovementComponent> velocityMapper;
    artemis::ComponentMapper<PositionComponent> positionMapper;

public:
    MovementSystem() {
        addComponentType<MovementComponent>();
        addComponentType<PositionComponent>();
    };

    virtual void initialize() {
        velocityMapper.init(*world);
        positionMapper.init(*world);
    };

    virtual void processEntity(artemis::Entity &e) {
        positionMapper.get(e)->posX += velocityMapper.get(e)->velocityX * world->getDelta();
        positionMapper.get(e)->posY += velocityMapper.get(e)->velocityY * world->getDelta();
    };

};
```
	
Usage:

``` cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {

    artemis::World world;
    artemis::SystemManager * sm = world.getSystemManager();
    MovementSystem * movementsys = (MovementSystem*)sm->setSystem(new MovementSystem());
    artemis::EntityManager * em = world.getEntityManager();

    sm->initializeAll();

    artemis::Entity & player = em->create();

    player.addComponent(new MovementComponent(2,4));
    player.addComponent(new PositionComponent(0,0));
    player.refresh();

    PositionComponent * comp = (PositionComponent*)player.getComponent<PositionComponent>();

    while(true){

        world.loopStart();
        world.setDelta(0.0016f);
        movementsys->process();

        std::cout << "X:"<< comp->posX << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Y:"<< comp->posY << std::endl;
        Sleep(160);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### LOGS


- Sept 11, 2012:
	- [Fixed critical bug](https://github.com/vinova/Artemis-Cpp/commit/731d2c3e6f4afbd32e4d33f08f23373d62b91dd9): deleting World doesn't delete/reset all neccessary data,
which will lead to memory violation when a World is deleted and a new one is created.
- Sept 12, 2012:
	- Removed all C++11 feature usages.
